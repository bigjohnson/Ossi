Atmega328p low power development boards programmable with Arduino bootloader or withouth bootloader with USBasp.

Very slow clock, very low current!

WARNING: Some internal slow clock mode can brick your atmega328p, to unbrick it you must use an external programmer, usbasp won't work. I use the [XGecu TL866II] (http://www.xgecu.com/EN/TL866_main.html)
